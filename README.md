**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: HARSHINI

**INTERN ID**: CT08GDC

**DOMAIN**: CYBERSECURITY AND ETHICAL HACKING

**BATCH DURATION**: DECEMBER 25TH,2024 TO JANUARY 25TH,2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTHOSH

**DESCRIPTION**:
 
  This modular penetration testing toolkit is built using Python to perform various security assessments, including network scanning, SSH brute-force attacks, and exploit execution. It provides a command-line interface where users can input targets and run different penetration testing modules.

**Tools & Libraries Used**:

socket â€“ for network scanning (detecting open ports).

paramiko â€“ for SSH brute-force attacks.

argparse â€“ for command-line argument handling.

**Expected Output**:

Port Scanning:

python main.py --scan 192.168.1.1

[+] Port 22 is open

[+] Port 80 is open

Brute-Force Attack:

python main.py --bruteforce user:password:192.168.1.1

[+] Login successful: user:password

python main.py --exploit 192.168.1.1

[+] Exploit executed successfully!

This toolkit is scalable, allowing more security modules to be integrated. ðŸš€
